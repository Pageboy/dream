          A Midsummer Night’s Dream is Shakespeare’s comedy at it s best. Based
          upon the quintessential and common theme of love, the play is set in
          an enchanted forest in a fictional land called Athens. It revolves
          around the tale of four lovers and an amateur troupe of actors whose
          lives are encountered and influenced by forest fairies led by their
          king Oberon and his estranged wife Queen Titania.

          In what appears as its most comical scene, Oberon influences Puck the
          mischievous sprite to cast a spell on Queen Titania making her fall in
          love with one of the minstrels. For good measure, Puck has replaced
          his head with that of a Donkey’s.
